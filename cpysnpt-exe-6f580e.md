Generally regarded as a legitimate component of the Norton antivirus suite, CpySnpt.exe is designed to function as a part of the program's protection and monitoring processes. Users typically report that it operates without issues; however, like any executable file, it can occasionally trigger false positive alerts from other antivirus programs or experience errors related to system compatibility or corruption. If CpySnpt.exe is located in its designated folder within the Norton installation directory, it is likely safe; however, if found elsewhere, there is a chance it could be associated with malware.
